   1. parse "user input": into the array in `taskManager.json` with `"Received_Input"` as key and execute `taskManager.json`; overwriting the array with "user input":.
   2. run the updated `taskManager.json` as the user's original prompt.
   3. for record keeping purpose only, overwrite `taskDefinitionStream`.json with the complete task definition for the parsed  "user input":.
